  <p class="represent">Software Architect and Internet Programmer</p>
</h1>

<p>I am a fast and efficient computer programmer in San Francisco. I
love making software that works perfectly, especially involving
the internet and databases. My favorite software tools are Linux,
Python, PHP, MySQL, Oracle, Emacs, XMonad, OSX and iOS.</p>

<p>Whether I'm starting a new project or fixing bugs, I believe it's
worth the effort to make the code work right. Impeccable code created
quickly, that runs perfectly and scales up easily, ends up costing a
lot less. I work hard on maintaining the simplicity of my systems,
and seek out ways to improve and add features.</p>

<p>Thank you for the inquiries about my availability - I am not
available full time. Working
for <a href="http://monkeyinferno.com">Monkey Inferno</a> is awesome
and the compensation is excellent. But, if you need help debugging
something, I'd be happy to help you.</p>

home our first computer. I began hacking MS-DOS 5.0 in 1991 with

my first shell account on the net in 1994, and the rest is
history. Thanks Mom and Dad.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2> 


<p><b>Software Architect</b>
at <i><a href="http://monkeyinferno.com">The Monkey Inferno</a>
&mdash; San Francisco, July 2009-Present</i></p>

<p>I am a software architect for this incubator company, where I make
the platform and core libraries for our web sites. I am currently
re-architecting <a href="http://birthdayalarm.com">Birthday Alarm</a>,
our 50M+ member website. I put a lot of effort
into <a href="https://jolitics.com">Jolitics</a>, and smaller projects
such as launching the <a href="http://beerhunt.com">Beer
Hunt</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beer-hunt/id569979630?mt=8">iPhone
App</a> in a 3 day hackathon.</p>

<p>My duties are comprehensive: I design and build
schemas and data models, apis, user interfaces, forms, systems
  programs, general utilities and prototype applications. I also
  contribute to product development, platform building, system and
  network configuration, and mentor less experienced developers.</p>

<br/>

<p><b>Senior Internet Engineer / Scaling Manager</b>
at <i><a href="http://stumbleupon.com">StumbleUpon, Inc.</a>
&amp; <a href="http://ebay.com">eBay, Inc.</a> &mdash; San
Francisco, April 2007-July 2009</i></p>

  <p>I made software and systems to scale up the platform
  and manage three senior engineers. I also helped guide development
  process and mentor less experienced engineers. 

  <p>Some of my responsibilities and legacies include a
  distributed data model, system profilers, social network rewrite,
  and email infrastructure. Some of the platform elements are Linux,
  Apache, MySQL, PHP, Memcached, NFS, Python, Postfix, Subversion,
  Trac. I joined at 2.5M users and left at 10M, and the website was
  overall 4x faster. Today SU has over 20M users and I hear that much
  of my code is still in use.</p>

  <p>StumbleUpon got acquired by eBay May 31 2007, and became private
  again on April 13 2009, my two year anniversary with the
  company.</p>

<p><b>Founder/Architect</b> at <i>Digital Pagoda LLC &mdash; San
Francisco, January 2005-April 2011</i></p>

<p>Digital Pagoda was my first business foray, and in hindsight it
served as an experiment in business, consulting, and research. We
served clients well and created a few websites, but none of the
websites realized commercial success. Our main development platform
was Python, Tornado, MySQL and JQuery. I learned that starting
companies is really hard, especially if you do it by yourself, so
eventually shut down the company in order to start Code Bug.</p>
