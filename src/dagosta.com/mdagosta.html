<p>I am a fast and efficient computer programmer in San Francisco. I
love making software that works perfectly, especially involving
the internet and databases. My favorite software tools are Linux,
Python, PHP, MySQL, Oracle, Email, Emacs, XMonad, OSX and iOS.</p>

<p>Whether I'm starting a new project or fixing bugs, I believe it's
worth the effort to make the code work right. Impeccable code created
quickly, that runs perfectly and scales up easily, ends up costing a
lot less time, money, and aggravation. I work hard on maintaining the
simplicity of my systems, and always seek out ways to improve and add
new features.</p>

<p>Thank you for the inquiries about my availability - I am not
available full time. Working
for <a href="http://monkeyinferno.com">Monkey Inferno</a> is awesome
and the compensation is excellent. But, if you want me to debug
something, I'd be happy to help you under
the <a href="https://codebug.com">Code Bug</a> banner on an evening or weekend.</p>

<h2>Startup Experience</h2>


<p><b>Software Architect</b>
at <i><a href="http://monkeyinferno.com">The Monkey Inferno</a>
&mdash; San Francisco, July 2009-Present</i></p>

<p>I am a software architect for this incubator company, where I make
the platform and core libraries for our web sites. I am currently
re-architecting <a href="http://birthdayalarm.com">Birthday Alarm</a>,
our 50M+ member website. I put a lot of effort
into <a href="https://jolitics.com">Jolitics</a>, and smaller projects
such as launching the <a href="http://beerhunt.com">Beer
Hunt</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beer-hunt/id569979630?mt=8">iPhone
App</a> in a 3 day hackathon.</p>

<p>My duties are comprehensive: I design and build
schemas and data models, apis, user interfaces, forms, systems
  programs, general utilities and prototype applications. I also
  contribute to product development, platform building, system and
  network configuration, and mentor less experienced developers.</p>

<p><b>Senior Internet Engineer / Scaling Manager</b>
at <i><a href="http://stumbleupon.com">StumbleUpon, Inc.</a>
&amp; <a href="http://ebay.com">eBay, Inc.</a> &mdash; San
Francisco, April 2007-July 2009</i></p>

  <p>I made software and systems to scale up the platform
  and manage three senior engineers. I also helped guide development
  process and mentor less experienced engineers.

  <p>Some of my responsibilities and legacies include a
  distributed data model, system profilers, social network rewrite,
  and email infrastructure. Some of the platform elements are Linux,
  Apache, MySQL, PHP, Memcached, NFS, Python, Postfix, Subversion,
  Trac. I joined at 2.5M users and left at 10M, and the website was
  overall 4x faster. Today SU has over 20M users and I hear that much
  of my code is still in use.</p>

  <p>StumbleUpon was acquired by eBay May 31 2007, and became private
  again on April 13 2009, my two year anniversary with the
  company.</p>

<p><b>Lead Software Engineer</b>
at <i>Kefta, Inc. &mdash; San
Francisco, May 2005-April 2007</i></p>

  Solaris, Oracle and Javascript. Designed HTTP Server, web
  interfaces, and statistics code. Sole developer for analytics
  reporting server using Oracle, Python, XML and Actuate. Provided
  guidance for less experienced team members, interviewed engineering
  candidates and provided sales support.</p>

<h2>Consulting Experience</h2>

<p>We fix your bugs so you don't have to, and help you make new
features. We offer expert bug fixing skills, software architecture and
web interface design.</p>

<p><b>Founder/Architect</b> at <i>Digital Pagoda LLC &mdash; San
Francisco, January 2005-April 2011</i></p>

<p>Digital Pagoda was my first business foray, and in hindsight it
served as an experiment in business, consulting, and research. We
served clients well and created a few websites, but none of the
websites realized commercial success. Our main development platform
was Python, Tornado, MySQL and JQuery. I learned that starting
companies is really hard, especially if you do it by yourself, so
eventually shut down the company in order to start Code Bug.</p>

<p><b>Operations Developer Consultant</b> at <i>Phenix Research
Associates &mdash; SF Bay Area, August 2002-May 2004</i></p>

<p>Wrote and operated system administration automation tools with Ruby

and development services.</p>
